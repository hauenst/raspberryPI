# RPControlHub Project
## Raspberry Pi Control Hub

This project provides a basic sructure to control multiple devices from a Raspberry Pi model B running Raspbian.

This project has been developed to control multiple devices as part of a collaboration between the HenLab at MIT Laboratory of Nuclear Science and JLab by Pedro F. Toledo.

This project uses some basic Serial, LXI, Apache and PHP technologies to provide a web-server that allows to centralyze the control of multiple devices through a simple web-site. You can go to the [Repository Wiki](https://github.com/ptoledo/RPControlHub/wiki) for more information about how to use it.

This project has been modularized so it can be eventually used for other purposes that involve the control centralization of multiple devices through a single tcp/ip link.
